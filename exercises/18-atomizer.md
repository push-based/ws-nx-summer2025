## 📚&nbsp;&nbsp;**Learning outcomes**

- Understand the concept of Nx Atomizer and why it is useful
- Learn how to use Nx Atomizer to split tasks into smaller chunks for our Playwright tests

## 🏋️‍♀️&nbsp;&nbsp;Steps:

### 1. Inspect whether Atomizer is already enabled

Open the project detail view for our `movies-app-e2e` project. You should see multiple runnable targets per Playwright spec file. If that's the case then Atomizer is enabled for our Playwright e2e tests.

**How?** This is because in `nx.json` we have the `@nx/playwright/plugin` registered which automatically enables Atomizer. Find the `plugins` section in `nx.json` and set `ciTargetName` to `false` on the Nx Playwright plugin configuration. This is how you switch off Atomizer. Check again the project detail view which should reflect that accordingly.

Check out the [docs on Atomizer](https://nx.dev/ci/features/split-e2e-tasks) for more information.

### 2. Enable Atomizer on CI

Make sure you have the `ciTargetName` set or remove it at all (since it is enabled by default).

Then adjust your CI configuration to leverage Atomized e2e targets instead of the default `e2e`.

- use the `e2e-ci` target instead of `e2e`
- make sure to update the stop-agents-after property accordingly

</details>

Push your changes to the remote repository and observe the CI logs and whether e2e tasks are now split across multiple agents.

### 3. Make sure atomized e2e tasks are distributed across multiple agents

**Did it work?** Note, for e2e tests we don't want to run multiple of them at the same time on the same machine, to avoid side-effects.

By default Nx runs tasks in parallel which can be controlled by the `--parallel` flag that can be passed to the Nx commands.

We don't want to have multiple run-many commands though like

```yaml
- run: npx nx affected -t lint test build deploy
- run: npx nx affected -t e2e-ci --parallel 1
```

As an alternative you can se the `parallelism` property on the target. Go to `nx.json` and make sure it is set to `false` for all `e2e-ci` targets.

<details>
<summary>🐳&nbsp;&nbsp;Hint</summary>

Since `e2e-ci` targets are generated dynamically and have different names you need to leverage wildcards.

```json
"e2e-ci--**/*": {
  ...
  "parallelism": false
}
```

</details>

Once you adjusted the `parallelism` property, push your changes to the remote repository and observe the CI logs and whether e2e tasks are now distributed across multiple agents.

```json
"e2e-ci--**/*": {
  ...
  "parallelism": false
}
```

</details>

## 🏃‍♂️‍➡️ Action Steps

**👟 Next Step:**
- Enable the task atomizer

**🧠 Discussion Topics:**
- Can you predict how enabling atomizer will affect your CI pipeline before you turn it on? How many new tasks will be created? How long will they run?
- What might cause a previously passing test to fail once atomizer is enabled?
